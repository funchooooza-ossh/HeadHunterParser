# HeadHunterParser

Hello there. This is selenium-based scrapper-parser. It will help you find good vacancies on head-hunter(hh.ru)
Just clone the repo, create venv and install requirments using "pip install -r requirments.txt"
Then go to headhunter, tune your filters such as location, salary, exp and so on.
After all this start main.py file and it will ask you for url, paste it, choose preffered count of processes(on my own system maximum count is ~50) 
Feel free to modify it for your own needs. 
Glad to help, Have a nice day!
